                    <div class="rev-text">Digital Fortress was the first tech-thriller I read, and it instantly pulled me into Dan Brown’s world of codes, secrets, and high-stakes tension. Though it’s not part of the main Robert Langdon series, it has the same sharp pacing and mind-bending twists that Brown is known for. The story follows Susan Fletcher, a brilliant cryptographer, as she uncovers a deadly secret buried within the NSA’s security system.

                        What I loved most was how it combined real-world tech concepts with heart-racing suspense. Even the quiet moments feel tense. The moral questions about privacy, surveillance, and who controls our information felt eerily relevant, and still do. It’s a fast read, but it left me thinking long after I turned the last page.
