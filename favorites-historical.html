                    <div class="rev-text">Reading Gone with the Wind was a completely immersive experience for me. I didn’t expect to connect so deeply with a story set during the Civil War, but once I started, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Scarlett O’Hara is one of the most complex characters I’ve ever read—there were moments I admired her grit and others where she completely infuriated me, but I was always drawn to her.

                        I found myself pausing often, not because I was bored, but because I needed time to process everything—Margaret Mitchell doesn’t shy away from the messiness of war, love, pride, and loss. The tension between Scarlett and Rhett felt incredibly real, and I kept hoping they'd find some kind of peace, even when they were their own worst enemies.
                        
                        This book didn’t just tell a story—it made me feel like I was witnessing an entire era unravel.

                    <div class="author-text"><b>Margaret Mitchell</b> (1900–1949) was an American author and journalist from Atlanta, Georgia. Before writing Gone with the Wind, she worked as a reporter for the Atlanta Journal Sunday Magazine, where she developed a sharp eye for storytelling and character. Though Gone with the Wind was her only novel, it became one of the most beloved books of all time. Mitchell poured years into researching and writing the story, never expecting it to earn the Pulitzer Prize or leave such a lasting impact. Her deep ties to the South and love of history shine through every page.
