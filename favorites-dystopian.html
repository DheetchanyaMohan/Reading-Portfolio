                    <div class="rev-text">When I first read The Hunger Games, I was completely pulled in by its intensity and pace. The world Suzanne Collins created felt so vivid and chilling—it made me think about power, survival, and resistance in a way I hadn’t before.

                        What really stayed with me was Katniss. I admired her strength, but even more, I connected with her fear, hesitation, and fierce loyalty. I found myself rooting for her not just because she was brave, but because she was human. Every decision she made felt heavy, and I felt that weight as I turned the pages.
                        
                        The book made me uncomfortable at times, but in the best way—it challenged me. I couldn’t stop thinking about the Capitol, the injustice, and how eerily close some parts of that world felt to our own. The Hunger Games wasn’t just a page-turner for me—it was a wake-up call wrapped in a compelling story.
