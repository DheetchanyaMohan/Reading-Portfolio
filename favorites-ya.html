                    <div class="rev-text">Queen of Hearts surprised me in the best way. I’ve always known the Queen of Hearts as this furious, “Off with their heads!” villain—but Colleen Oakes flips the script and gives her a backstory that actually makes you feel for her. Dinah, the future Queen, is fierce, stubborn, and navigating a kingdom full of secrets and betrayal. You can’t help but root for her, even as you sense the darkness slowly creeping in.

                        What I loved most was how Oakes takes a familiar world—Wonderland—and makes it feel completely fresh, darker, and more emotionally complex. It’s not just fantasy, it’s a story about power, loss, and becoming something you never meant to be. I flew through the pages, eager to know how Dinah’s journey would twist and turn.
