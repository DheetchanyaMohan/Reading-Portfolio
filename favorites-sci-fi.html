                    <div class="rev-text">Reading Fahrenheit 451 felt like stepping into a chilling mirror of our own world—one where books are banned, ideas are dangerous, and screens have replaced meaningful conversations. What struck me most wasn’t just the dystopian setting, but the quiet desperation of the main character, Montag, as he starts to question everything he's been told to destroy.

                        Bradbury doesn’t just warn us about censorship—he dives deep into what makes us human: curiosity, emotion, the hunger to understand. The language is poetic but piercing, and though the book is short, its impact is lasting. It’s one of those stories that lingers, making you pause before turning on the TV or scrolling your phone. It reminded me why books matter—why stories matter.
